## Quantitative Analysis

### Cumulative Returns
As reflected in the cumulative return plot, the following two portfolios outperform the S&P500 Returns:  

    1) Berkshire Hathaway, Inc and 2) in-house portfolio, Algo 1.  
    
Noteably, Algo 1 led the entire group when compared to the cumulative returns of the others portfolios.  

### Daily Standard Deviation - Volatility
The daily standard deviation dataframe reflects that Berkshire Hathaway, Inc and Tiger Global Management LLC had the two highest daily standard deviation.  

We performed this function by sorting the values in descending order and identifying which portfolios were larger and above the S&P500. Consequently, this will also be the same when reviewing the annual volatility (standard deviation).   

The sharpe ratio bar chart, reflects that Algo 1 leds the portfolio group based on a a balance of risk and reward.  Algo 1 is the only portfolio that outperformed the S&P500 as indicated within the bar chart.  Please see note attached Jupyter Notebook.

However, as compared to the annual volatilty of the S&P500 and the TSE S&P60 during my same time frame:
S&P500       0.246025
TSE S&P60    0.212521

From a sharpe ratio perspective, the three stocks I selected had a positive relationship reflecting a more conservative risk reward than the S&P500 Index. These stocks characteristics balances risk and reward, as they are considered mutual funds with a diversified holding.
