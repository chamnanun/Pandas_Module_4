## Quantitative Analysis

### Cumulative Returns
As reflected in the cumulative return plot, the following two portfolios outperform the S&P500 Returns:  Berkshire Hathaway, Inc and in-house portfolio, Algo 1.  Noteably, Algo 1 led the entire group when compared to the cumulative returns of the others portfolios.  

### Daily Standard Deviation - Volatility
The daily standard deviation dataframe reflects that Berkshire Hathaway, Inc and Tiger Global Management LLC had the two highest daily standard deviation.  We performed this function by sorting the values in descending order and identifying which portfolios were larger and above the SP500. Consequently, this will also be the same when reviewing the annual volatility.   

The sharpe ratio bar chart, reflects that Algo 1 leds the portfolio group based on a a balance of risk and reward.  Algo 1 is the only portfolio that outperformed the S&P500 as indicated within the bar chart.  Please see note attached Jupyter Notebook.
